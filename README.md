## Hello everyone 👋 I’m Varag  


If you came here expecting a polished “Hi, I’m a developer with 5 years of experience blah blah,”  
sorry — wrong door.  

I’m a postgraduate student who spends most of my time poking around **IoT devices** and  
asking existential questions like *“why is my smart fridge updating firmware at 3 AM?”*  

Cybersecurity is my playground — not because I love breaking things (okay, maybe a little),  
but because I don’t trust anything that claims to be “secure by default.”  

When I’m not reading packets on Wireshark or pretending to configure Linux like a wizard,  
I’m either:  
☕ Overdosing on coffee,  
😂 Making bad jokes my friends still laugh at (out of pity),  
🤔 Or staring at my router wondering if it’s secretly judging me.

### 🎭 A little philosophy  


Tech is fun. Security is chaos. Life is somewhere between those two.  
I don’t promise polished repos or enterprise-ready code here —  
what you’ll find instead is curiosity, experiments, and maybe a few rabbit holes  
that I’m still figuring out myself.  

If you stuck around reading till here, congrats — you’ve officially wasted more time  
on my README than I did writing it.
